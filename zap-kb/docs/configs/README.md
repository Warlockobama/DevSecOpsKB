Experimental detection metadata (reference only)

This directory contains reference/experimental detection metadata for OWASP ZAP plugins
collected during early iterations. The current enrichment flow in the code uses the
`internal/zapmeta` package to source detection info from ZAP docs and related repos.

These files can be useful for manual review or as overrides, but they are not read by the
tool at runtime.
